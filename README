This is a Rails project I spun up for my wife who had a web portfolio project for her masters degree at UT.

This project lives at http://jaciharris.com

NOTES:
This project is specifically for my wife but I would like to create an admin portal and dashboard that would allow people to spin up web portfolios using the templates from the app.  I'd like to generate subdomains for people want to spin up their own web portfolio quickly and efficiently.
